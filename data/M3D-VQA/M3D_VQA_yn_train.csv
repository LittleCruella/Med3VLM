83547,M3D_Cap_npy/ct_quizze/002507/Sagittal_C__portal_venous_phase.nii.gz,Large well-defined solid-cystic mass lesion axial width up to 90 x 80 mm and height up to 80 mm within anterior inferior abdominal wall rectus abdominis muscle partially extended within midline and contralateral rectus abdominis muscle is seen. The mass has a pronounced bulge within related subdermal fat and is minimally bulged within the related anterior pelvic cavity. Hypodense focus with size up to 25 x 18 mm in upper medial segment VIII of the right hepatic lobe with enhancement consistent with a hemangioma.,5,Does the mass extend beyond the midline?,Yes,No,,,No,B

83552,M3D_Cap_npy/ct_quizze/002508/Sagittal_C__delayed.nii.gz,"Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) images demonstrate a heterogeneous mass with dural attachment in the posterior fossa which causes obstructive hydrocephaly. In the bone window, the lesion erodes the skull base.Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement and vascular structures within the lesion.",4,Does the heterogeneous mass show enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT)?,Yes,No,,,Yes,A
83573,M3D_Cap_npy/ct_quizze/002511/_Scout.nii.gz,"There is evidence of incarcerated right paraumbilical hernia containing transverse colon, with inflammation of hernial fat and obstructive dilatation of colon proximal to it. However, the herniated bowel loop shows normal contrast enhancement. Hernia defect measures 2.7 x 2.7 cm. Dilated caecum measures up to 10 cm diameter. No perforation. No dilatation of small bowel loops.",4,Does the herniated bowel loop show signs of ischemia or necrosis?,Yes,No,,,No,B
